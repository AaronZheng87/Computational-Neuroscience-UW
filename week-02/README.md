The file eigenfaces.py contains an implementation of the algorithm used to calculate eigenfacse. To run this script you first have to download a database of faces to which you can apply the algorithm.

In addition, the following notebooks are provided:

## [Poisson spiking neuron](poisson_neuron.ipynb)

Demonstrates how a Poisson spiking neuron can be simulated

## [Linear encoding models](linear_encoding_models.ipynb)

Illustrates the concept of a linear encoding models using examples from retinal ganglion cells and primary visual cortex simple cells
