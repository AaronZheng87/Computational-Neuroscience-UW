## [Information and entropy](Information and entropy.ipynb)

This notebook illustrates several basic concepts of information theory such as information, entropy and mutual information. As an example, I used mutual information to find out what the relation is between the standard deviation of a gaussian tuning curve and the mutual information with a stimulus dimension to which the neuron is tuned.
