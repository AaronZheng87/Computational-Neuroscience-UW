# Computational-Neuroscience-UW
The University of Washington offers an [online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience/home/welcome) on computational neuroscience taught by Adrienne Fairhall and Rajesh Rao. In this repository I collect scripts that I created to better understand the course material. For convenience, this scripts have also been implemented in IPython notebooks which can be viewed directly on Github.
