# Computational-Neuroscience-UW
The University of Washington offers an [online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience/home/welcome) on computational neuroscience taught by Adrienne Fairhall and Rajesh Rao. In this repository I collect scripts that I created to better understand the course material. A more organized approach can be found in the Ipython notebooks. These are based on my Python scripts but are better organized and contain additional explanation of everything that is happening. Feel free to use this material as you want!

The following content is included:

- Week 2: Examples of how linear filtering can be implemented, an illustration of how a Poisson spiking neuron can be coded and last but not least a demo for calculating your own eigenfaces!

- Week 3: An introduction to signal detection theory and an example of maximun likelihood estimation to decode presented stimulus value from a population of neurons

- Week 4: An introduction to information theory, including an attempt at investigating the optimal tuning width for a gaussian tuned cell using mutual information criterion

- Week 5: Neuron models ranging from simple RC circuits to integrate and fire, exponential integrate and fire and Hodgkin-Huxley models



There are three more weeks that I want to cover so keep checking back if you're interested!
