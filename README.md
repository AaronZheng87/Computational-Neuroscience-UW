# Computational-Neuroscience-UW
The University of Washington offers an [online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience/home/welcome) on computational neuroscience taught by Adrienne Fairhall and Rajesh Rao. In this repository I collect scripts that I created to better understand the course material. For convenience, this scripts have also been implemented in IPython notebooks which can be viewed directly on Github. 

The following content is included:

- Week 2: Attempts for solution to the exercises in the first chapter of Theoretical Neuroscience (Dayan & Abbot)

- Week 3: An introduction to signal detection theory and an example of maximun likelihood estimation to decode presented stimulus value from a population of neurons

- Week 4: An introduction to information theory, including an attempt at investigating the optimal tuning width for a gaussian tuned cell using mutual information criterion

- Week 5: Neuron models ranging from simple RC circuits to integrate and fire, exponential integrate and fire and Hodgkin-Huxley models
