This week we covered the topic of neural decoding and saw different techniques for extracting stimulus information from single neurons and populations of neurons.

## [Likelihood ratio](likelihood_ratio.ipynb)
Shows how the likelihood ratio test can be used to detect which of two stimuli was presented for a neuron that responds with a gaussian distribution to each stimulus.

## [Maximum likelihood estimation](maximum_likelihood_estimation.ipynb)
Shows how the value of a continuous stimulus dimension can be extracted based on spiking activity from a population of neurons.

## [Population vector](population_decoding.ipynb)
Illustrates the principles of the population vector method to decode wind direction in the cricket cercal system and arm directions from motor neurons.

## [Motion discrimination](motion_discrimination.ipynb)
Simulates the neural responses from the motion discrimination task performed by Britten et al (1992). Also introduces the concept of ROC curves.

In addition, I found that the following articles to be relevant to the topic of this week:
