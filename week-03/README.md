Likelihood ratio.ipynb
Illustrates the principles of likelihood ratio calculation using an example with two gaussian response distributions

## [Maximum likelihood estimation](Maximum likelihood estimation.ipynb)
Simulates a population of gaussian tuned neurons and shows how we can predict which stimulus has been shown using the maximum likelihood estimation technique
